      "['New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo seems intent on dispelling any myths surrounding the government’s efforts to go door-to-door to make sure everyone gets vaccinated.', 'No, he’s made things perfectly clear that it is his “mission” to make sure that the government is sending people door-to-door to talk them into getting the jab.', 'Just so we’re clear that this was the plan all along.', 'Cuomo announced a new campaign to cleanse the unwashed, unvaccinated masses of the Empire State during a media briefing at Yankee Stadium in New York City on Monday, and it sounds a bit, uh, aggressive.', 'During his remarks, in which he announced the allocation of $15 million in funds to promote vaccination among the 3.5 million New Yorkers who have yet to get the shot, the governor rather bluntly declared the idea is not simply to make sure everyone has information, but that they’re convinced, bundled up in a vehicle, whisked off to a vaccination site and jabbed.', 'In other words, he’s basically admitting that his administration would all but force New Yorkers to get an injection they’d otherwise be hesitant to get.', 'This is essentially what’s happening there. We’re only a hair away from this degree of utter and total fascism.', '“We have to get in those communities, and we have to knock on those doors, and we have to convince people, and put them in a car, and drive them, and get that vaccine in their arm,” he declared, sounding increasingly more threatening as he continued on with this alarming yarn.', '“That is the mission,” he concluded.', '', 'I guess there’s going to be no dancing around the whole door-to-door efforts in New York state, as the White House has done to quell concerns that government agents were going to be visiting unvaccinated residents to force them to overcome their hesitancy.', 'While the governor said that 75 percent of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, he laid on the alarmism concerning the pesky 25 percent that he, like so many other leaders, is convinced just hasn’t made up their mind and is waiting for a community volunteer to come knock on their door armed with government talking points before they brandish their arm to be injected.', '“Three and a half million unvaccinated people,” Cuomo said, according to WROC- TV. “These numbers can be hard to put into context, but 3.5 million is larger than 21 other states’ total population. We have an unvaccinated population larger than the entire population of 21 states, and then when you put this COVID delta variant — which is transmitted much easier than the normal COVID virus — you put that variant with 3.5 million people, that spells ‘spread of COVID.’ That is what is happening. We know that’s what’s happening, we see it in the numbers, and numbers don’t lie.”', 'He also claimed that any concerns over so-called “breakthrough” cases — when the virus “breaks through” the immunity the vaccine is meant to provide — are unfounded, pointing to a rate of only 0.15 percent of vaccinated New Yorkers that have tested positive for the virus.', 'The governor did discuss a softer-sounding approach to the community outreach efforts to increase vaccination rates as cases of COVID-19 climb and leaders across the nation and world increasingly tighten the grip on the iron fist they promised they’d loosen once everyone got their jab.', '“We need a different approach and the approach has to be community-based organizations who can have conversations in the community with people who know them culturally, know their issues, their fears,” Cuomo also said on Monday.', '“And it has to be a one-on-one conversation with that 25 percent because it’s not going to be a top-down message. It has to be someone who speaks their language, literally and figuratively, and says, ‘Let’s talk about this, tell me what you’re worried about, tell me what your fear is,’ and then address it with facts. And that’s what we’re going to do today.”', 'So, walk softly and carry a big stick to thwack people over the head with and drag them off to the clinic? Because that sort of sounds like where he’s going with this community outreach effort.', 'The Democrats aren’t even trying to hide their determination to wrestle Americans into submission — and to thoroughly demonize those who won’t.', 'To borrow and tweak a recent question posed by Candace Owens, when in the whole of human history have the good guys been the ones requiring papers to visit public places and talking about going door-to-door to get people to take an experimental injection in their arm?', 'This is antithetical to everything our country was founded to protect. The Founding Fathers must be rolling over in their graves.']\n"

      "Peter Doocy Grills Psaki on Biden's Past Skepticism of COVID Vaccine Developed Under Trump\n",
      "Bradley Cortright\n",
      "2021-08-11\n",
      "White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki says the data has not shown that President Joe Biden created vaccine hesitancy by raising questions about its development while he was a candidate. \n",
      "During a White House press briefing on Wednesday, Psaki was asked by Fox News’ Peter Doocy, “As the president tries to reach unvaccinated Americans, has there been any thought given, looking back, to the possibility that he may have created some vaccine hesitancy when last year around this time the previous administration was rushing to get a vaccine authorized?”\n",
      "He noted that then-candidate Biden said, “I trust vaccines, I trust scientists, but I don’t trust Donald Trump, and at this moment, the American people can’t either.”\n",
      "“I think it’s safe to say he still doesn’t trust Donald Trump, so that hasn’t changed,” Psaki responded. “But he does trust scientists. He does trust data experts. And he does trust the people leading the CDC, the FDA, which is the gold standard of approval for vaccines.”\n",
      "She also noted that Biden has credited experts and scientists in the Trump administration for “moving the vaccines forward.”\n",
      "Still, Doocy asked, “At the time, when Donald Trump is out there saying, ‘We’re going to have a vaccine in the next couple weeks, next couple months’ and Joe Biden is out on the campaign trail saying, ‘Don’t trust Donald Trump,’ did that create any kind of vaccine hesitancy?”\n",
      "“Not that we’ve seen in the data. I would note that at the time, just for context, the former president was also suggesting people inject versions of poison into their veins to cure Covid. So, I think that’s a relevant point,” Psaki said.\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "\n",
      "When Doocy noted that Biden also suggested that the country wait for the FDA to grant full authorization for the vaccine, the press secretary said, “The FDA works on the timeline of science. At the same time, we’ve also seen tens of millions of people’s lives saved who have gotten the vaccine.”\n",
      "According to Politifact, “Biden’s statements on the campaign trail show that he was concerned that politics would influence the development and deployment of the vaccine, and that Trump could not be trusted.”\n",
      "During an interview in August 2020, he said, “The way he (Trump) talks about the vaccine is not particularly rational. He’s talking about it being ready, he’s going to talk about moving it quicker than the scientists think it should be moved…People don’t believe that he’s telling the truth, therefore they’re not at all certain they’re going to take the vaccine. And one more thing: If and when the vaccine comes, it’s not likely to go through all the tests that need to be done, and the trials that are needed to be done.”\n",
      "And in September, he asked, “When a president continues to mislead and lie, when we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, who’s going to take the shot? Who’s going to take the shot? You going to be the first one to say, ‘Put me — sign me up, they now say it’s OK.’”\n",
      "Several studies have found that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. \n",

      "Vice President Mike Pence received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a televised White House event Friday morning, calling it “a medical miracle.”\n",
      "Pence is the highest-ranking U.S. official to receive a dose of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, which was found to 95 percent effective in trials.\n",
      "“I didn’t feel a thing. Well done,” Pence told the medical staff at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "While journalists, so-called experts, and verified Twitter users cast doubt on President Donald Trump and Operation Warp Speed’s efforts to ensure the creation, production, and distribution of a safe and effective vaccine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted last week to approve Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use and mass distribution.\n",
      "In his address on Friday morning, Pence reassured the public that the vaccine is safe and effective.\n",
      "“Hope is on the way,” Pence said. “The American people can be confident.”\n",
      "“We have one, and perhaps within hours, two safe vaccines,” he added, noting the pending FDA approval of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine.\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after technicians vaccinated Pence, his wife Karen, and U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams also publicly received a dose of the vaccine in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on camera.\n",
      "“Karen and I were more than happy to step forward before this week was out to take this safe and effective coronavirus vaccine,” Pence said. “It’s a truly inspiring day.”\n",
      "Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton have all also volunteered to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the public eye once it is available to them with hopes to boost Americans’ confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence that the coronavirus might have come from the Wuhan Institute of Virology has been in plain sight since the start of the pandemic. Why did Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, ridicule and dismiss it? Why did mainstream media attack anyone who pointed it out?\n",
      "There is still much we don’t know about Covid-19. I tried not to be critical of officials forced to make tough decisions with limited, imperfect information. But as new information becomes available, it’s a matter of life and death to integrate what we learn into future policy decisions.\n",
      "It’s often hard to admit being wrong. When mistakes might have cost a life (or lives), the tendency to justify or cover it up could be overwhelming. In hindsight, I believe many mistakes were made before and during the pandemic. I’m glad the press is finally beginning to investigate the lab origin theory and what role U.S. gain-of-function research might have played. I have many unanswered questions.\n",
      "Another blunder that I tried to address was federal agencies’ failure to robustly explore and conduct studies on using combinations of repurposed generic drugs in early treatment. One year and almost 600,000 American lives later, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are finally encouraging trials for a “pill” to reduce viral replication and severity of symptoms. Better late than never, I guess.\n",
      "What may turn out to be a triumph of historical proportions is Operation Warp Speed and the deployment of an effective vaccine in record time. Based on early data, the vaccines appear to be very effective and safe for the vast majority of people.\n",
      "But even before the vaccines’ use was authorized, many doctors I consulted were expressing concerns over indiscriminate mass vaccination. They were particularly worried about lack of benefit and hyperactivating responses in individuals previously infected with Covid-19.\n",
      "I tested positive for Covid-19 in September 2020. I recently had a serology test showing a high level of antibodies. Multiple articles in the NIH’s library and a new Israeli study indicate natural immunity is as or more effective than the vaccine. Thus, the vaccine offers no proven benefit for me and only the chance of harm. Yet pressure to vaccinate everyone, regardless of medical necessity or safety, rapidly increases. Why?\n",
      "In the United States, the supply of vaccine now exceeds demand. Everyone choosing to be vaccinated can be. Based on current science, their chance of getting infected from a non-vaccinated person is extremely low. It is also becoming apparent that the hype over asymptomatic spread was false — another blow to federal health agency credibility.\n",
      "As of May 21, the Centers for Disease Control’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports 4,265 deaths after vaccination, 3,494 within 30 days, and 1,592 on Day 0, 1 or 2. VAERS also shows 14,949 adverse effects resulting in hospitalization. This doesn’t prove causation, but it doesn’t rule it out.\n",
      "Fauci and others who have a duty to robustly investigate any link to vaccination don’t seem to be taking VAERS seriously. As a result, independent event adjudication and data safety monitoring committees should be established to fully investigate these reports.\n",
      "There is also growing anecdotal evidence of potential vaccine harm to a minority of previously infected individuals that is hard to ignore. Dr. J. Barton Williams of Tennessee, Christopher Sarmiento of New Mexico, Brandy McFadden of Tennessee, Everest Romney of Utah, and Princess Michael of Kent in the United Kingdom are some publicly reported examples.\n",
      "Yet the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, and mainstream media seem to be largely ignoring these. Despite the articles and studies referenced above, the FDA inexplicably issued new guidance stating that the presence of antibodies from a Covid-19 infection does not prove immunity. With most viruses, infection leads to immunity. Why would federal agencies’ default assumption with Covid-19 be the exact opposite?\n",
      "I strongly supported Operation Warp Speed, get an annual flu shot, and am current with other recommended vaccines. But the determined push for indiscriminate vaccination of the previously infected, of pregnant women, and of children causes me to ask questions.\n",
      "A fundamental of medical ethics is that people have the right to choose or refuse treatment. No one should be pressured, coerced, or fear reprisal for refusing treatment — including the Covid-19 vaccine. Yet colleges are threatening termination for employees and denial of admission for students who choose not to be vaccinated. Other organizations are instituting similar coercion.\n",
      "Many mistakes were made in how we handled the pandemic. Too often, freedoms have been taken away or, maybe worse, willingly given up, in reaction to the state of fear government officials and media have created. Let’s not compound these mistakes by forcing a successful vaccine on everyone, irrespective of their medical need or condition.\n"

      "Only 0.2 Percent of COVID Vaccines Have Gone to Poor Countries\n",
      "Jake Johnson\n",
      "2021-04-12\n",
      "The head of the World Health Organization estimated in a recent address that of the more than 700 million coronavirus vaccine doses that have been administered across the globe, just 0.2% have gone to people in low-income nations — inequity that experts warn will persist unless rich countries end their obstruction of an international effort to suspend vaccine patents.\n",
      "Speaking to the media on Friday, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus warned that “there remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines” as pharmaceutical companies cling to their monopoly control over technology that was developed with large infusions of public money.\n",
      "“On average in high-income countries, almost one in four people has received a vaccine. In low-income countries, it’s one in more than 500,” said Tedros. “Let me repeat that: one in four versus one in 500.”\n",
      "Tedros went on to lament the struggles of the global vaccine initiative COVAX, which he said “had been expecting to distribute almost 100 million doses by the end of March” but has instead only sent out 38 million due to “a marked reduction in supply.” COVAX has partnered with several major pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca and Pfizer, in an effort to ensure access to vaccines in developing countries.\n",
      "“The problem is not getting vaccines out of COVAX; the problem is getting them in,” said Tedros.\n",
      "These numbers seem staggeringly unfair.\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "\n",
      "The Associated Press reported Saturday that “as many as 60 countries, including some of the world’s poorest, might be stalled at the first shots of their coronavirus vaccinations because nearly all deliveries through the global program intended to help them are blocked until as late as June.”\n",
      "“COVAX, the global initiative to provide vaccines to countries lacking the clout to negotiate for scarce supplies on their own, has in the past week shipped more than 25,000 doses to low-income countries only twice on any given day. Deliveries have all but halted since Monday,” AP noted. “During the past two weeks, according to data compiled daily by UNICEF, fewer than two million COVAX doses in total were cleared for shipment to 92 countries in the developing world — the same amount injected in Britain alone.”\n",
      "According to a recent Bloomberg analysis of vaccination data, “the world’s least wealthy continent, Africa, is also the least vaccinated. Of its 54 countries, only three have have inoculated more than 1% of their populations. More than 20 countries aren’t even on the board yet.”\n",
      "The ongoing struggles of COVAX and the inadequacy of bilateral vaccine agreements have only served to heighten calls for more sweeping action at the international level to redress inequities that could prolong and intensify the global pandemic.\n",
      "One effort, led by South Africa and India, to temporarily lift vaccine-related intellectual property rights has gone nowhere due to wealthy World Trade Organization members such as the United States and the United Kingdom, whose opposition has left vaccine production largely under the control of major pharmaceutical corporations.\n",
      "Proponents say South Africa and India’s patent waiver — supported by more than 100 nations around the world and predictably opposed by the pharmaceutical industry — would accelerate production and distribution of doses by allowing manufacturers to replicate vaccine formulas.\n",
      "Terrible: At current global vaccination rate, the world will reach herd immunity in 4.6 years\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "Found Garbage\n",
      "\n",
      "Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), wrote in a blog post Friday that “getting the world vaccinated is not about some feel-good gestures, like a few billion dollars for COVAX.”\n",
      "“It means pulling out all the stops to produce and distribute billions of vaccines as quickly as possible. To do this, we need the cooperation of the whole world and the elimination of all the barriers to the production and distribution of vaccines,” Baker argued. “This would mean suspending intellectual property claims over these vaccines. From a moral standpoint, this should not be a tough call since governments paid for so much of the development costs.”\n",
      "“What are we going to do if a new and more deadly vaccine-resistant strain develops in Zambia or Burma? I don’t want to hear another chorus of ‘who could have known?’ from our intellectuals who missed another huge one,” Baker continued. “Let’s get it right this time, even if it means having to do things a little differently. Our leaders are not forced to take a vow of incompetence.”\n"
